## project
#### last semester i had a seminar about olga neuwirth - a contemporary composer - and a friend of mine had the critic that "every song sounds the same"
#### i want to analyse if the features of her songs are the same or not and if they are not the same i want to take a look on how they changed by time
#### i also want to analyse the character of her music in general - does the features of her music represent her personal character? the texts we read about her in the seminar assumed this - she is a very depressed person and shows this depression in her music (i analysed two of her works, *Bählamms Fest* and *Lost Highway*, and the Valence was about mValence ~0.07 sdValence ~0.05 and meanValence ~ 0.14 and sdValence ~0.13) so this aspect for those work examples is very clear
#### another aspect of her works is the presence of "the other" - this concept draw through her so called "musicstallations" - i am suspicious if this "other" shows in any features (maybe compared to other contemporary composers like Adriana Hölszky or Luigi Nono, whom kind of inspires her)
