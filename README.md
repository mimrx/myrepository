## project
#### last semester i had a seminar about olga neuwirth - a contemporary composer - and a friend of mine had the critic that "every song sounds the same"
#### i want to analyse if the features of her songs are the same and what character her music has in general - if the features are not the same i want to take a look on how they changed by time
